## Hatum The Project

Hatum The Project (AKA หาทำ The Project) is a project that I made after final test in first term of year 1 in SKE. This project is made because after I finish final test a COVID-19 pandemic in in Thailand is start rising again so... yes! STAY AT HOME! During that time it's so boring and I start watching YouTube then I fell into a rabbit hole. Yes, vtuber! I watch 3 channel first (Gura, Calliope, Pekora) and then it's start spreading like a pandemic LOL. I listen to 'a' word all day from Gura so I want to spam this all day but YouTube is too slow to spam so I startmaking a website that can spam 'a' from Gura's mouth. After that I start practice using Google API start with Drive and YouTube to make an app using Python (Yes, I am sure about my Python most.) and at this time I'm writing this journal (11 Jan 2021 00:29) It's not finish. I think this project will continuing depend on my inspiration and my 'Hatum (หาทำ)'.
