## Hatum The Project

Hatum The Project (AKA à¸«à¸²à¸—à¸³ The Project) is a project that I made after final test in first term of year 1 in SKE. This project is made because after I finish final test a COVID-19 pandemic in in Thailand is start rising again so... yes! STAY AT HOME! During that time it's so boring and I start watching YouTube then I fell into a rabbit hole. Yes, vtuber! I watch 3 channel first (Gura, Calliope, Pekora) and then it's start spreading like a pandemic LOL. I listen to 'a' word all day from Gura so I want to spam this all day but YouTube is too slow to spam so I startmaking a website that can spam 'a' from Gura's mouth. After that I start practice using Google API start with Drive and YouTube to make an app using Python (Yes, I am sure about my Python most.) and at this time I'm writing this journal (11 Jan 2021 00:29) It's not finish. I think this project will continuing depend on my inspiration and my 'Hatum (à¸«à¸²à¸—à¸³)'.

## Kasumi

I dreaming to make this a bot a long time ago but due to my knowledge in coding and other purpose make me postpone this project. And from *Hatum The Project* I find a project that I want to make and I found an old repo of this Kasumi (It's getting deleted) so I want to use this time that I stuck in COVID and I have a lot of time on my computer (along with *Hatum The Project*)to continue make this Kasumi, a character from *BanG Dream!* that I love (but so many people hate this character ðŸ˜¥). She has many dream that so many people think it's nonsense like me. That's why I love this character so much!

I want to make her alive so in fist phase I want to build a code from a ground with Pyhton (cuz I know it most) and if I know more about JS I will migrate this bot to other version.
